# Energy-Consumption
This is the mini project that me and my teammates did for a 30 hour hackathon where we bagged the second prize

Steps to run it in your localhost:

1. Download all files
2. Create a new folder, lets say "energy" in your D drive
3. Create a folder named "templates" and store all the html files
4. Create a folder named "static" and store all the css files
5. So the folder must look like below
   energy >
     static >
       formcss.css
       resultcss.css

     templates >
       form.html
       result.html

     app.py

6. Now open command prompt, and navigate down to energy folder
7. Create a virtual environment using venv commmand
8. After activating the environment you will notice a new folder named "venv" to be appeared in the energy folder
9. Run app.py
10. DONE AND DUSTED
